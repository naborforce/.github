# Hello, Nabor! 👋

## Backup sons and daughters
Naborforce is a service that is bridging the gap between full independence and “home/companion care” by providing light support for older adults who just need a friendly hand from time to time. We connect our clients to a network of “Nabors” for social engagement and on-demand support for errands, transportation and help around the home.

It’s who to call for help with all those little things that keep your parents – or you – independent and happy. Whether you’re busy balancing your career, raising kids, live out of town or just need a little support, let Naborforce provide a backup son or daughter on-demand. 

Our goal is to promote productive, connected, and joyous aging and living. 

We are the perfect solution for active, independent older adults who don’t need a caregiver yet. For older adults or families seeking licensed “care,” companion or home care is the right alternative.

### 🦦 Contributing to the ecosystem

We contribute to the open source community and plan to deliver our own open source projects over time.  For now, contributing is restricted to Naborforce team members; you all can start [here](https://github.com/naborforce/engineering/blob/main/README.md).
